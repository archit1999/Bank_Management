# Bank_Management

v1 :- 
    - basic cmd runnable application with operations like creating bank acc, fetching balance, deposting and withdrawing money (virtually though).
    - HashMap is used to store the info, i.e., info doesnt retains itself if the application is closed... working on using MySQL in next version.
    
v1.1 :- 
    - made a storage Interface, which defines 2 methods, insert and fetch, and is supposed to be implemented by any class which acts as DB.
    - AccountsHashMap implements this method.
